# French Accent Keypad Feature Specification

## Overview
This feature provides an accessible on-screen keypad for entering French accented characters in free text input fields throughout the RockLingo application. This addresses the common challenge of typing French special characters on keyboards that may not have dedicated accent keys.

## Problem Statement
Students learning French often struggle to input accented vowels and special characters when their keyboard layout doesn't support them natively. This creates friction in the learning experience, particularly in exercises that require text input like translation challenges and spelling exercises.

## Feature Description

### Visual Design
- A compact, unobtrusive keypad that appears near text input fields
- Shows the most commonly used French accented characters
- Clean, modern design that matches the application's theme
- Responsive layout that works on both desktop and mobile devices

### Characters to Include
The keypad should display the following French special characters:
- **Accented vowels**: à, è, é, ê, ë, î, ï, ô, ù, û, ü, ÿ
- **Uppercase variants**: À, È, É, Ê, Ë, Î, Ï, Ô, Ù, Û, Ü, Ÿ
- **Other special characters**: ç, Ç, œ, Œ, æ, Æ

### Functionality

#### Activation
- The keypad should automatically appear when a user focuses on a text input field in question types that accept French text
- Should be toggleable via a small icon button next to the input field
- User preference to show/hide by default should be saved in settings

#### Character Insertion
- Clicking a character button inserts that character at the current cursor position
- Maintains cursor position after insertion for continuous typing
- Works seamlessly with existing text without replacing selections
- Supports both click and touch events for mobile compatibility

#### Keyboard Shortcuts (Optional Enhancement)
- Alt/Option + number keys (1-9) for quick access to most common accents
- Customizable shortcuts in settings

### Integration Points

#### Affected Components
- `TranslationInput.tsx` - Primary use case for translation exercises
- `ReverseTranslation.tsx` - When translating to French
- `SpellingChallenge.tsx` - For spelling French words
- Any future components with free text input for French

#### Technical Considerations
- The keypad should be a reusable component
- Should not interfere with native keyboard input
- Must maintain accessibility standards (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Should work with React's controlled input components
- Position should be calculated to avoid viewport overflow

### User Experience

#### Desktop
- Keypad appears as a floating panel below or beside the input field
- Can be dragged to reposition if needed
- Subtle animation on show/hide
- Hover states for buttons

#### Mobile
- Keypad appears above the device keyboard
- Larger touch targets for easier selection
- Considers safe areas and keyboard height
- Smooth transitions that don't disrupt typing flow

### Accessibility
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible with proper ARIA labels
- High contrast mode support
- Follows WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Settings and Preferences
- Toggle to enable/disable the accent keypad globally
- Option to set default visibility (always show, always hide, or auto)
- Choice of keypad position preference
- Option to customize which characters appear

### Performance
- Lazy loaded to avoid impacting initial page load
- Minimal re-renders when typing
- Efficient event handling
- No impact on application performance when hidden

### Future Enhancements
- Support for other language special characters (Spanish ñ, German ü, etc.)
- Smart suggestions based on typing patterns
- Integration with spell check for accent corrections
- Voice input for accented characters

## Success Criteria
1. Users can easily input French accented characters without leaving the application
2. The feature doesn't interfere with users who prefer traditional input methods
3. Reduces user-reported friction with French character input

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for character insertion logic
- Integration tests with existing input components
- User acceptance testing with students learning French
