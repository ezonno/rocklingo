- Implementation should be backed by unit tests
- french_dutch_workbook.md should be the source of the questions
- Development should happen in branches
- Pull request should be created to merge work into the main branch
- specs should go into the spec folder
- when asking to create a spec, do not implement it yet
- always run test to verify your work
- always lint your work
