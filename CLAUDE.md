# Rules
- Implementation should be backed by unit tests
- Development should happen in branches
- Not allowed to commit direct to main
- Pull request should be created to merge work into the main branch
- specs should go into the spec folder
- when asking to create a spec, do not implement it yet
- always run test to verify your work
- always lint your work
- After implemting a phase or spec write a summary in an IMPLEMENTATION file
