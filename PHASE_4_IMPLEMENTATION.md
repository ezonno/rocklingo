  total: number;
  category?: string;
}

// Achievement System
interface Achievement {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  icon: string;
  unlockedIcon: string;
  condition: (sessions, questionProgress) => boolean;
  progress?: (sessions, questionProgress) => { current: number; target: number };
}

// Category Metadata
interface CategoryData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  icon: string;
  questions: number;
  mastered: number;
  accuracy: number;
  totalAttempts: number;
  correctAttempts: number;
}
```
