# French Learning Application Development Plan

## Project Overview
A React-based French vocabulary learning application for a 13-year-old Dutch student, featuring interactive exercises, progress tracking, and gamification elements. The app will be hosted on GitHub Pages without requiring a backend.

## Educational Best Practices Research

### Effective Language Learning Techniques for Teenagers:
1. **Spaced Repetition**: Questions should revisit previously learned words at increasing intervals
2. **Multi-Modal Learning**: Combine visual, auditory, and kinesthetic elements
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Instant correction with explanations
4. **Progressive Difficulty**: Start easy and gradually increase complexity
5. **Gamification**: Points, streaks, and achievements to maintain motivation
6. **Context-Based Learning**: Words presented in meaningful contexts when possible
7. **Active Recall**: Prioritize production (writing) over recognition (multiple choice)

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- LocalStorage for data persistence
- GitHub Pages for hosting

### Key Libraries:
- `react-confetti` for celebration animations
- `react-circular-progressbar` for progress visualization
- `react-toastify` for notifications
- `howler.js` for audio feedback (optional)
